This is a mod for Dicey Dungeons to make it use "die" as the singular version of "dice", as is standard in American English.

It is currently in alpha and has only been tested a little. It's possible you could encounter some totally broken text if you use this.

How to install:

Put the "die" folder in SteamApps/common/Dicey Dungeons/mods

Then add "mod=die" to the launch options in Steam. (or on the command line)

Then launch the game, press esc, and choose "language". The game will restart itself and then show you a list of languages. If "Singular Die" is visible, pick it. If it's not, you might need to then manually restart your game, and then it should show up in the list.
